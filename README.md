# codiv

Performs Host-Microbe Codiversification Scans

<!-- badges: start -->

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `codiv` R package performs codiversification scans between pairs of
host and symbiont phylogenetic trees. The main functions accepts a host
tree, a symbiont tree, and a data.frame that links which symbionts were
isolated from which hosts. It outputs a correlation coefficient for each
node of the symbiont tree denoted how well itâ€™s topology is correlated
with the host tree. Nodes with a high degree of correlation are
consistent with codiversification between hosts and those symbionts.
Other helper functions are also included.
